                <p>Green Plank® got its start by seeing the building supplies and construction industries from a different point of view. A beautiful home. A better world. We make the connection.</p>
                <p>Already in 2004, we started to produce composite products by experimenting with different types of wood and agricultural residues in combination with recycled plastic. As we have grown, we have gained extensive knowledge and experience. Maintaining our quality through continuous improvement and innovation, we develop our products in line with the tradition and industry’s requirements. With independent testing and certification, we ensure products perform according to specification. Today, we are supplying our high quality products to European and North American markets.</p>
